# CollaborationApplication
   In today's digital age,various collaboration tools exist to help two or more people to reach a common goal.<br>
This project focuses on creating a collaboration tool that can be used by multiple people irrespective of their geographical location.<br>
<b>The common feature you will find on collaboration sites are:</b>
####1.Communication like voicemail/Instant messaging/VoIP/video call.
####2.Chat rooms.
####3.Blogs.
####4.Forums.
####5.Friend.
####6.Job Notifications etc.

##Technology Framework used during the project

##Environment Framework used during the project
####1.Source Control: GitHub.

Amongst the above environment frameworks, I would like to give a brief description about DevOps.<br>
DevOps is a culture or practice that emphasis the collaboration and communication of both sofware developers<br> 
and other Information-Technology(IT) professionals while automating the process of sofware delivery and infrastructure changes.<br>

In this project, I have tried to implement these modules.This project would always have enhanced features to implement.<br> 
Any ideas from the people are always welcome.
